# Badge/Lead Scanning

As a KCD you are allowed to offer lead scanning on-site at your event, as this is a direct opt-in from the attendee to the sponsor to share their data.

Past and current organizers have shared success with the following:
* Generation of conference badges through this open source python program CNCF Ambassador William Rizzo generated, called [ConfBadger](https://github.com/wrkode/ConfBadger)
* For the actual software running on your phone, KCD UK (5x KCD in 2025) has had success using https://www.badgerscan.org/. Badgerscan is not installable on modern Android phones in its current state.
* Android phones with F-droid can use [QR & Barcode Scanner](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.example.barcodescanner/). The app allows the user to export the history as CSV or json and data is stored locally on the device.

An on-site badge template for your attendees to wear can be [found in Canva here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGDholi8n8/H5jrZt9T1D3H_OpV07Hsnw/view?utm_content=DAGDholi8n8&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h9db5bc675f).
