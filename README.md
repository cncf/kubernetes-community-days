# About KCDs

Previsouly known as Kubernetes Community Days, KCDs are community-organized events backed by CNCF support. They gather adopters and technologists from open source and cloud native communities to learn, collaborate, and network to further advancement in Kubernetes and other Cloud Native technologies. They also are a lot of fun and a great way to meet new people and build community.

## Host a KCD

Each event brings its own local flair, culture, diversity, and authenticity. For more about details about organizing an event see the [organizing page](https://github.com/cncf/kubernetes-community-days/tree/main/planning). Check the [project board](https://github.com/cncf/kubernetes-community-days/projects/2) to join one being organized near you, or to host on yourself, please visit the [KCD About Page via cncf.io](https://www.cncf.io/kcds/).

### Contact a specific event

Organization is decentralized. Local events handle their own sponsorships, registration, and all other organizations. For questions about a specific event you see listed on the site, contact the local organizers for that event; their email is on their contact page.

## The Organizer Experience  
Organizing an event can be daunting, if you are new at this, some organizers suggest getting your feet wet with a one-day event, or two half-day events. Even if you have a small event of 100 people, the same amount of detail should still be considered. That is why we at the CNCF are here to guide you. Please take advantage of the resources above. Please note - we are always working on adding more and bettering what we already have.

We are now hosting *a monthly KCD Organizer focus group*. As of now, it will be hosted one Wednesday each month, for 1 hour, from 7:00 - 8:00am PT / 10:00 - 11:00am ET / 4:00 - 5:00pm CEST. Please contact kcd@cncf.io if you would like to be added, or if you would like an additional time that accommodates your region.
