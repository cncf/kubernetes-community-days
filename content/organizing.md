## Interested in Organizing a Kubernetes Community Day(s)?

Check to see if there is a Kubernetes Community Days event scheduled in your area on the events page.  If there is an event scheduled, please reach out to the organizers to express your interest in helping. You can find a list of current events being planned on the website along with contact details for the organizers.

If there isn’t an event being organized, the first step in building out a successful event, is assembling a team. You’ll need at minimum 3 other organizers from 3 different organizations.  Ideally, you’ll have a minimum of 5 organizers. One of the organizers must be a CNCF Member employee, Ambassador, or CNCF Project Maintainer. Find local community members who may be interested in helping to organize or volunteer at the event:

* Local user groups
* Community Ambassadors
* [Meetup groups](/events/)

Check the GitHub Repo issues for other individuals who have expressed an interest in organizing an event in your area. If there are no GitHub issues for your area, create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/cncf/kubernetes-community-days/issues/new) following the template to express an interest in organizing an event in your area. 
Cloud Native Computing Foundation helps support Kubernetes Community Days with guidance and promotion.We will cover all the key aspects of holding an event in the sections below, with break out documents for extended sections. 

Keep in mind, Kubernetes Community Day events are visionary, educational, and provide user-driven content. Organizers should avoid sales pitches in crafting the program for their event. Kubernetes Community Days events are inclusive, this means making reasonable efforts to support others in the community who want to help organize, attend, or sponsor, regardless of affiliation.
