# About Kubernetes Community Days 
Kubernetes Community Days are community-organized events that gather adopters and technologists from open source and cloud native communities to learn, collaborate, and network to further adoption and improvement of Kubernetes. They are supported by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). They also are a lot of fun and a great way to meet new people and build community. Each event brings its own local flair, culture, diversity, and authenticity.  

We would like to give a generous thank you to [DevOpsDays](https://devopsdays.org) and [OpenStack Days](https://www.openstack.org) for their guidance and inspiration,  and in particular for providing the basis of this document.

# Interested in Hosting a Kubernetes Community Days?
## Contact a specific event
Kubernetes Community Days organization is decentralized. Local events handle their own sponsorships, registration, and all other logistics. For questions about a specific event you see listed on the site, contact the local organizers for that event; their email is on their contact page.

## Interested in Organizing a Kubernetes Community Days?

Check to see if there is a Kubernetes Community Days event scheduled in your area on the events page. If there is an event scheduled, please reach out to the organizers to express your interest in helping. You can find a list of current events being planned on the website along with contact details for the organizers.

If there isn’t an event being organized, the first step in building out a successful event is assembling a team. You’ll need at minimum 3 other organizers from at least 2 different organizations.  Ideally, you’ll have 5 or more organizers. One of the organizers must be a CNCF Member employee, Ambassador, or CNCF project maintainer. You can ofter find local community members who may be interested in helping to organize or volunteer at local user groups and Meetups, such as the [CNCF Meetup groups](https://www.meetup.com/pro/cncf/).

Check the GitHub Repo [porject board](https://github.com/cncf/kubernetes-community-days/projects/2) for other individuals who have expressed an interest in organizing an event in your area. If there are no GitHub issues for your area, create an [issue](https://github.com/cncf/kubernetes-community-days/issues/new?assignees=christinevblum%2C+iennae&labels=planningevent&template=interest.md) to express an interest in organizing an event in your area. 
CNCF helps support Kubernetes Community Days with guidance and promotion. We will cover all the key aspects of holding an event in the sections below, with break out documents for extended sections. 

Keep in mind, Kubernetes Community Day events are visionary, educational, and provide user-driven content. Organizers need to avoid sales pitches in crafting the program for their event. Kubernetes Community Days events are inclusive. This also means making reasonable efforts to support others in the community who want to help organize, attend, or sponsor, regardless of their organizational affiliation.

## Getting Started Checklist

* No other Kubernetes Community Day event in the local area
* Minimum of 3 organizers from 2 different organizations
* At least one organizer is a CNCF Member employee, Ambassador, or CNCF Project Maintainer
* You have a method to accept payments including sponsorships and to payout expenses
* All organizers have signed off to the event guidelines and CNCF Code of Conduct
* Local event website will be hosted on Kubernetes Community Days site 
* Organizers are local to the event location

Once your organizing team has signed off on the event guidelines and completed the Getting Started checklist, create an [issue](https://github.com/cncf/kubernetes-community-days/issues/new?assignees=christinevblum%2C+iennae&labels=newevent&template=host.md) to get your event officially recognized. The event team will be invited to the Kubernetes Community Days Event Organizers Slack channel where you can connect with other Kubernetes Community Days organizers around the world. You can then begin creating your website, by copying the page structure of the [Bouvet Island](https://kubernetescommunitydays.org/events/2020-bouvet-island/) event. Here are directions to do so.


## Event Details 
Most events are developer-focused. Some are more focused on business issues and cloud strateg, 

Similar events have 100-400 attendees. Most start small and grow each year. 

The overarching rule about content is that Kubernetes Community Days are not to be used for commercial pitches. Any platforms or tools you are describing need to be open source.

That said, many (most?) talks will be about how companies relied on open source technologies to improve their processes.

If the event creates a profit, it needs to be held and reinvested in future years. Organizers should aim to get all of their actual expenses reimbursed, but not their time.

## Logos and Trademarks
Once your event has been accepted (i.e., shows up on [kubernetescommunitydays.org](https://kubernetescommunitydays.org)), you are authorized by CNCF to use that name (e.g., Kubernetes Community Days Bouvet Island). We encourage you to design a custom logo for your event. Please note that the logo can’t include all or part of the Kubernetes wheel, but does need to include the event name. You are welcome to include the CNCF logo in your event logo and graphics, and you’re also welcome to use [Phippy](https://phippy.io/) and friends (high-res versions available in the artwork [repo](https://github.com/cncf/artwork/blob/master/examples/other.md#phippy--friends-group-logos)).

Please post your logo in SVG format, as [explained](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2019/07/17/what-image-formats-should-you-be-using-in-2019/) in this blog post.
  
* Consider offering special pricing such as early bird registration and promotional pricing
* The event must be at least a one day long
* Set and monitor bank accounts, online payments (PayPal, etc.) and registration (Eventbrite)

* Attendance needs to be available to anyone until the availaibty capacity is sold out 
* The attendee list may not be used for commercial or marketing purposes. It may only be used to advertise that specific Kubernetes Community Day or further iterations of it. The list may not be shared with third parties who are not directly involved in organizing the event. Please review the [Kubernetes Community Privacy Policy Statement](http://www.Kubernetes Community.org/privacy).
* Sponsors are allowed to collect attendee information at their tables
* We recommend event organizers add the following statement to the registration page: “Personal information gathered by the organizers is handled in accordance with the Foundation’s Privacy Policy and is used for internal purposes only.  The Kubernetes Community Privacy Policy is available at [http://www.Kubernetes Community.org/privacy](http://www.Kubernetes Community.org/privacy).
 
# Kubernetes Community Days Branding:

# Assembling Your Team
In the Kubernetes Community Days spirit of collaboration, find people in your region that want to help you run the next awesome event. For your local organizing team, we suggest you have  focus on specific areas.

## Budget and Finances 
Basic guidelines

* Add up the budgets (venue, food, parties space, schwag) to generate a total event budget to determine the amount of money needed to cover costs
* Plan on covering most of the expenses through sponsorships to keep ticket prices low
* Ticket prices should generally be somewhere between $50 and $100, depending on location and event costs 
* Allocate some budget for scholarships/discounts for students and underrepresented groups
* Allow 10% overage as there are often unexpected costs

Role of finance team/lead

* Set-up online payments to allow sponsors to pay directly (and avoid procurement and paper checks)
* Set and monitor bank accounts, online payments (PayPal, etc) and registration (Eventbrite)
* Invoice sponsors and accepting payments 
* Accept money from sponsors (and issue official invoices)
* Move money between accounts as needed to pay suppliers like the venue, catering, swag, etc.

Finance management options

* Option 1: the organizer's companies serve as the finacial sponsor. 
* Option 2: Use a fiscal sponsor, which generally takes a 10% fee. LIST TEH
* This may be one of the companies of a volunteer or core organizing team
* Generally, finance sponsor collects 8-10% overhead Option 2 - designate someone on the team to run finances
* Time-consuming and tedious - we recommend that a finance sponsor be secured for the first year of the event 
Rewrite this section. Option 1 is to have one of the organizer's companies serve as finance sponsor. Option 2 is to use a fiscal sponsor, which generally take a 10% fee.[ List the ones recommended by DevOpsDays.]
