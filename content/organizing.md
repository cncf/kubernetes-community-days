## Interested in Organizing a Kubernetes Community Day(s)?

Check to see if there is a Kubernetes Community Days event scheduled in your area on the events page. If there is an event scheduled, please reach out to the organizers to express your interest in helping. You can find a list of current events being planned on the website along with contact details for the organizers.

If there isn’t an event being organized, the first step in building out a successful event, is assembling a team. You’ll need at minimum 3 other organizers from 3 different organizations.  Ideally, you’ll have a minimum of 5 organizers. One of the organizers must be a CNCF Member employee, Ambassador, or CNCF Project Maintainer. Find local community members who may be interested in helping to organize or volunteer at the event:

* Local user groups
* Community Ambassadors
* [Meetup groups](/events/)

Check the GitHub Repo issues for other individuals who have expressed an interest in organizing an event in your area. If there are no GitHub issues for your area, create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/cncf/kubernetes-community-days/issues/new) following the template to express an interest in organizing an event in your area. 

Cloud Native Computing Foundation helps support Kubernetes Community Days with guidance and promotion. We will cover all the key aspects of holding an event in the sections below, with break out documents for extended sections. 

Keep in mind, Kubernetes Community Day events are visionary, educational,and provide user-driven content. Organizers should avoid sales pitches in crafting the program for their event. Kubernetes Community Days events are inclusive, this means making reasonable efforts to support others in the community who want to help organize, attend, or sponsor, regardless of affiliation.

# Kubernetes Community Days Content & Programing
Basic Guidelines

* ALWAYS vendor neutral
* Always sensitive and appropriate
* Have fun and promote fun
* Encourage interaction

# Recruiting Speaker

* Expect to recruit people for speaker proposals
 * Have a good stock of proposal ideas ready to offer to potential speakers to spark their creative process
 * Offer to brainstorm with them to help create content
 * Reach out to known event speakers in the K8s channel and ask if they have ideas that might be good (or if they want to speak at the event!)
* Recruiting a diverse speaker slate requires extra effort
 * Contact organizations like Women Who Code and Black Girl’s Code
 * Check relevant meetups for past speakers
* Consider bringing in speakers from outside the region to improve diversity
* Announce as early as possible - included open date, close date, date people will be informed of selection

 * Keep the call to be open for at least a month
 * Allow 2 weeks to consider proposals and fill in any gaps

Judging proposals

* Publish the proposal rating systems and be transparent about it
* Publish the names of the programming committee
* Be prepared to explain any programming decisions

# Content considerations
* Encourage new content; give higher priority to content that has not been published elsewhere
* Try for a good balance between local and out-of-town speakers
* Favor new speakers: Kubernetes Community Days is a supportive environment to encourage new voices in our space

# Set up a clear timeline on content reviews
* Regularly check-in with speakers to ensure they are making progress
* Schedule at least two live video run throughs of presentations before the event
* Be sure the programming can review every presentation well in advance
* Identify all A/V requirements for each presentation
 * Do they need video playback?
 * Live coding?
* Day of event make sure to check in with all speakers and ensure they are OK
* Post event, provide constructive feedback on the speaker’s presentation with concrete advice

# Budget and Finances 
Basic guidelines

* Add up the budgets (venue, food, parties space, schwag) to generate a total event budget to determine the amount of money needed to cover costs
* Plan on covering most of the expenses through sponsorships to keep ticket prices low
* Ticket prices should be somewhere been $50 and $100, depending on location and event costs 
* Allocate some budget for scholarships/discounts for students and underrepresented groups
* Allow 10% overage, as there may be unexpected costs

Role of finance team / lead

* Setup online payments to allow sponsors to pay directly (and avoid procurement and paper checks)
* Set and monitor bank accounts, online payments (PayPal, etc) and registration (Eventbrite)
* Invoice sponsors and accepting payments 
* Accept money from sponsors (and issue official invoices)
* Move money between accounts as needed to pay suppliers like the venue, catering, swag , etc.

Finance management options

* Option 1 - secure a finance sponsor
* This may be one of the companies of a volunteer or core organizing team
* Generally finance sponsor collects 8-10% overhead Option 2 - designate someone on the team to run finances
