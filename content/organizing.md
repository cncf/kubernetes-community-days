title: Organize a Kubernetes Community Days

# About Kubernetes Community Days 
Kubernetes Community Days are community-organized events that gather adopters and technologists from open source and cloud native communities to learn, collaborate, and network to further advancement in Kubernetes. They also are a lot of fun and a great way to meet new people and build community. Each event brings its own local flair, culture, diversity, and authenticity.  

We would like to give a generous thank you to [DevOpsDays](https://devopsdays.org) and [OpenStack Days](https://www.openstack.org) for their guidance and inspiration.

# Interested in Hosting a Kubernetes Community Days?
## Contact a specific event
The organization is decentralized. Local events handle their own sponsorships, registration, and all other logistics. For questions about a specific event you see listed on the site, contact the local organizers for that event; their email is on their contact page.

## Interested in Organizing a Kubernetes Community Days?

Check to see if there is a Kubernetes Community Days event scheduled in your area on the events page. If there is an event scheduled, please reach out to the organizers to express your interest in helping. You can find a list of current events being planned on the website along with contact details for the organizers.

If there isn’t an event being organized, the first step in building out a successful event is assembling a team. You’ll need at minimum 3 other organizers from 2 different organizations.  Ideally, you’ll have a minimum of 5 organizers. One of the organizers must be a CNCF Member employee, Ambassador, or CNCF Project Maintainer. Find local community members who may be interested in helping to organize or volunteer at the event:

* Local user groups
* Community Ambassadors
* [Meetup groups](/events/)

Check the GitHub Repo issues for other individuals who have expressed an interest in organizing an event in your area. If there are no GitHub issues for your area, create an [issue](https://github.com/cncf/kubernetes-community-days/issues/new?assignees=christinevblum%2C+iennae&labels=planningevent&template=interest.md) to express an interest in organizing an event in your area. 

Cloud Native Computing Foundation helps support Kubernetes Community Days with guidance and promotion. We will cover all the key aspects of holding an event in the sections below, with break out documents for extended sections. 

Keep in mind, Kubernetes Community Day events are visionary, educational, and provide user-driven content. Organizers should avoid sales pitches in crafting the program for their event. Kubernetes Community Days events are inclusive. This means making reasonable efforts to support others in the community who want to help organize, attend, or sponsor, regardless of affiliation.

## Getting Started Checklist

Cloud Native Computing Foundation will set up a placeholder website.

# Kubernetes Community Days Content & Programing
Basic Guidelines 

* Encourage bold, innovative, thought-provoking subjects
* Events usually have four 30-min talks per day + ignite talks
* Avoid specific technology/product talks: always try to elevate it to the conceptual balance between technical and community content
* For specific tool talks, there are open spaces and smaller rooms onsite
* Open space sessions are scheduled during the conference, not ahead of time (have attendees vote on topics during the event)
* ALWAYS vendor-neutral
* Always sensitive and appropriate
* Have fun and promote fun
* Encourage interaction
* Pick an event name that reflects the location (i.e. Seattle Kubernetes Community Days)

## Recruiting Speaker 

* The [CNCF Speakers Bureau](https://www.cncf.io/speakers/) is a great place to start
* Expect to recruit people for speaker proposals
 * Have a good stock of proposal ideas ready to offer to potential speakers to spark their creative process
  * Offer to brainstorm with them to help create content
   * Reach out to known event speakers in the K8s channel and ask if they have ideas that might be good (or if they want to speak at the event!)
* Recruiting a diverse speaker slate requires extra effort
 * Contact organizations like Women Who Code and Black Girl’s Code
 * Check relevant meetups for past speakers
  * Consider bringing in speakers from outside the region to improve diversity
* Announce as early as possible - included open date, close date, date people will be informed of selection 
 * People will usually need at least 4-6 weeks to arrange for travel or time off
 * Keep the call for papers open for at least a month
 * Allow 2 weeks to consider proposals and fill in any gaps
* Announcing call for and judging proposals


## Judging proposals

* To minimize bias, create a reasonable proposal rating system
* Set a point scale for each of the proposal points (e.g. originality, big idea, new speaker, high quality speaker) and award each proposal points on the scale then aggregate points for scores
* Publish the proposal rating systems and be transparent about it
* Publish the names of the programming committee
* Be prepared to explain any programming decisions

## Content considerations

* Encourage new content; give higher priority to content that has not been published elsewhere
* Try for a good balance between local and out-of-town speakers
* Favor new speakers: Kubernetes Community Days is a supportive environment to encourage new voices in our space

## Set up a clear timeline on content reviews

* Regularly check-in with speakers to ensure they are making progress
* Schedule at least two live video run-throughs of presentations before the event
* Be sure the programming can review every presentation well in advance
* Identify all A/V requirements for each presentation
 * Do they need video playback?
 * Live coding?
* The day of event make sure to check in with all speakers and ensure they are OK
* Post-event, provide constructive feedback on the speaker’s presentation with concrete advice

## Budget and Finances 
Basic guidelines

* Add up the budgets (venue, food, parties space, schwag) to generate a total event budget to determine the amount of money needed to cover costs
* Plan on covering most of the expenses through sponsorships to keep ticket prices low
* Ticket prices should be somewhere been $50 and $100, depending on location and event costs 
* Allocate some budget for scholarships/discounts for students and underrepresented groups
* Allow 10% overage as there may be unexpected costs

Role of finance team/lead

* Set-up online payments to allow sponsors to pay directly (and avoid procurement and paper checks)
* Set and monitor bank accounts, online payments (PayPal, etc) and registration (Eventbrite)
* Invoice sponsors and accepting payments 
* Accept money from sponsors (and issue official invoices)
* Move money between accounts as needed to pay suppliers like the venue, catering, swag, etc.

Finance management options

* Option 1 - secure a finance sponsor
* This may be one of the companies of a volunteer or core organizing team
* Generally, finance sponsor collects 8-10% overhead Option 2 - designate someone on the team to run finances
* Time-consuming and tedious - we recommend that a finance sponsor be secured for the first year of the event 

## Marketing & Promotion
Role of the Marketing Team

Guidelines and rules

* Sponsorship does not equal speaking slot
* Sponsors will need to pay upfront to make the event work
* Sponsors cannot commercialize the event
* Sponsorship should cover 80-90% of total even budget
* Signing up sponsorships is a lot of work - two volunteers are better than one
