# Co-Located Events
Kubernetes Community Days bring together the community and can be a great way to get people more involved in open source. They present an opportunity to grow the cloud native community. Some examples are listed below: 


## Kubernetes Contributor Summit
Would you like to become a Kubernetes contributor but don't know where to start? The Kubernetes Contributor Summit is made especially for this. Join us at an event where we'll explore topics like “community organization”, “how to contribute if I can't program in Go” and even do your first PR in a sample repository and understand how bot commands work.

## Mentoring Sessions
The community collectively has an immense depth of knowledge and expertise which we can explore and learn from at this collaborative event. Whether you’re new, or not so new to open source and the cloud native community, we invite you to attend. You’ll have the chance to meet with experienced open source veterans across many CNCF projects. You will be paired with other people in a pod-like setting to explore technical, community, and career questions together.
