# Registration
Once pricing has been decided you’re ready to set up registration. For registration use, [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) integrated with PayPal payments. The PayPal account for payment needs to be linked directly to the company that does the invoicing. (Note: if using Eventbrite, use Paypal, not “Eventbrite payment processing”, or you’ll have to wait for Eventbrite to disperse funds after your event.)

Considerations for registration:

* Attendees may be charged a registration fee but the amount must be minimal; less than $100 USD is strongly recommended  
* Consider offering special pricing such as early bird registration and promotional pricing
* The event should be published and attendance should be completely open to the public, the only restriction being venue capacity
* The attendee list may NOT be used for commercial or marketing purposes, only community-building activities, such as sharing event updates or scheduling future meetups. The list will not be shared with third parties who are not directly involved in organizing the event. Please review the Kubernetes Community Privacy Policy Statement.
* We recommend event organizers add the following statement to the registration page: “Personal information gathered by the organizers is handled in accordance with the Foundation’s Privacy Policy and is used for internal purposes only.  The Kubernetes Community Privacy Policy is available at [http://www.Kubernetes Community.org/privacy](http://www.Kubernetes Community.org/privacy).
* In order for the Foundation to gather consistent demographic information, we are asking that event organizers add the following question to the registration page. Please share this information and any other survey information with CNCF when you send in post-event information.

* What is your current Organizational Role at your company? (please check one):

 * Business Development/Sales/Marketing
 * CEO/Executive Leadership
 * CIO/CTO/IT Manager
 * Cloud Application Developer

Here are some suggestions that will be useful to you in your registration process.

* Ask for employer name (optional) if people want it printed on their badge
* Ask for a Twitter handle (optional) to help attendees connect with one another
* Ask for T-shirt sizes (make sure you offer more than S-M-L-XL “unisex”)
* (In Europe) ask if they require an invoice; if yes ask more details like VAT number if needed
* Ask if they are interested in attending the evening event on the first night (optionally)
* Disable the facebook integration
* Don’t allow people to see who is coming
* Set up hidden ticket types for sponsors, organizers, speakers, etc
* Create access codes for hidden ticket types

Attendee email or direct-contact information should never be visible on the website or given out to vendors.
