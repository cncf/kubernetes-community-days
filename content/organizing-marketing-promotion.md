title: Marketing and Promotion
---

Once you have a time and place, you can announce your event to the world! It’s great if you’ve had a chance to open your CFS and registration, though those aren’t essential to announce your dates.

Role of the Marketing Team

* Drive interest in the event
* Drive ticket sales
* Promote event content and speakers
* Run social promotions, email promotions, blogs and ads
* Highlight event diversity
* Manage site content via this website 

Promotion

* Who can help spread the word that the event is scheduled?
 * Reach out to local tech companies and consultants
 * Contact local tech publications and see if you can swap media sponsorship for ads in their publication or on their website
 * Reach out to local tech incubators and VCs to see if you can be included in newsletters, post flyers on event board, etc.
 * Local universities (if they have CS departments, for example)
 * Contact your local Meetups and ask them to promote your event 
 * Contact Code academies to see if they will help you promote
 * Ask the Sponsor companies to email their contacts and invite them to attend

Online marketing

* Promote your event in the Sponsors and Organizers corporate newsletters, websites, emails, etc
* Promote sponsorship, speakers, CFS, on LinkedIn

Website

* Update your data file for your event to add your start & end dates; this adds your event to the map on the front page!

Twitter

* Set up an event-specific Twitter account such as @kubernetesdays(city initials)
* Tag @kubernetesdays in your tweets 
* Send tweets to the KCD-organizers slack channel to be retweeted
* Tweet with the hashtag #KubernetesCommunityDays
* Following the initial, pinned post, one organic post per day should be shared to alert followers of the change + resources for Kubernetes Community Day events
* Start following any/all dedicated #KubernetesCommunityDays Twitter accounts

Twitter Posting Style, Images, and Official Hashtag

Style

* The following style guide addresses how to craft social media posts:
* Adhere to established CNCF voice + style:
 * Inclusive, Useful, Encouraging, Open, Informative, Personable
 * Do not use stereotypes
 * Respect the diversity of the community; be inclusive of all genders and races and sensitive to concepts such as meritocracy
 * Be sensitive to all genders and use gender-neutral language and terms when necessary (they, them, their)
 * Never engage in arguments or plug products → content should be vendor-neutral aside from sponsor mentions

Images

* Stand-alone, snackable graphics can be shared to increase visibility around events for greater registration or to feature speakers and/or sponsors needing promotion. These provide a visual way to communicate information that would otherwise account for a text-heavy post, including:
* CFP and registration deadlines;
* Speaker cards; and
* Sponsor cards.
* Professional images and/or those shared by the community can be posted during or after events to highlight the range of event features + promote community engagement.

Event Hashtag

* To avoid fragmentation + establish brand awareness in the community, the official event hashtag to be used will be the same as the event handle: #KubernetesCommunityDays
