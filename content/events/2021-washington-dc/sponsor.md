# Sponsors

Kubernetes Community Days (KCD) is a community-driven, non-profit conference for practitioners. All sponsorship funds will be used to offset event-related expenses. In short, the more support we receive, the more our attendees and sponsors will benefit.

## Why sponsor KCD?

KCD attracts IT practitioners and executives who have already implemented or are planning to implement Kubernetes within their organization. Whether you seek to recruit new talent, demo your product, or connect with existing customers, KCD provides the perfect platform to engage with the local Kubernetes community.
You can find available sponsorships and add-ons below. If you are interested in supporting us, please get in touch via mail: [sponsors-dc@kubernetescommunitydays.org](mailto:sponsors-dc@kubernetescommunitydays.org).
