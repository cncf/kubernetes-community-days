# Kubernetes Community Days in our Nation's Capital

# Novel Coronavirus Update

Due to the current pandemic and to keep everyone safe, we decided to postpone the event to 2021. We hope that the beginning of next year will be safe enough to meet in-person. Stay safe and hope to see you all in March 2021.

# Hosted at American Red Cross, a CNCF Nonprofit Member

We are excited to announce the Kubernetes Community Days in Washington, DC is being held on March 16, 2021 -- the first of its kind in the DC Metro Area. Join us for a one-day technical conference, filled with thought-provoking talks and networking opportunities at the historic Red Cross Square in downtown Washington, DC.

[Subscribe to our KCD DC mailing list](https://mailchi.mp/9bba9529e871/kubernetescommunitydayswashingtondc) and/or follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KubeDaysDC) for event updates.
