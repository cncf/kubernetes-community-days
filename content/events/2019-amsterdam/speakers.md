## Interested in Organizing a Kubernetes Community Day(s)?

Check to see if there is a Kubernetes Community Days event scheduled in your area on the events page. If there is an event scheduled, please reach out to the organizers to express your interest in helping. You can find a list of current events being planned on the website along with contact details for the organizers.

If there isn’t an event being organized, the first step in building out a successful event, is assembling a team. You’ll need at minimum 3 other organizers from 3 different organizations.  Ideally, you’ll have a minimum of 5 organizers. One of the organizers must be a CNCF Member employee, Ambassador, or CNCF Project Maintainer. Find local community members who may be interested in helping to organize or volunteer at the event:
