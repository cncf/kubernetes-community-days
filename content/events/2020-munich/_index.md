## **Kubernetes Community Days** in Munich have been postponed

Unfortunately given the recent developments around COVID-19 it's very difficult
for us to say how things will play out in the coming months and how it'll
effect the event space in general later this year. Due to these
uncertainties we have decided to postpone the Kubernetes Community Days Munich
2020 to an unspecified date.

We have thus closed the Eventbrite registration and all tickets already bought
will be refunded. We're also in touch with our supporters about the possiblity
to sponsor the future event instead, or issue a refund.

We want to thank everyone who has reached out to us in the form of a talk proposal,
offering sponsorship or just expressing interest in our event. We do hope that
the situation will soon become clearer and that we can announce a new date for
Kubernetes Community Days Munich as soon as possible. ðŸ’™
