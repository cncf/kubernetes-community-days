[Alte Münze](https://alte-muenze-berlin.de/) is an old coin press building and lies in the very heart of Berlin, nearby the Spree river. We don’t want to promise too much, but Alte Münze will definitely give you the Berlin-vibe you are looking for.

Please have some patience. We’ll be adding directions soon.
