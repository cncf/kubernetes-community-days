Kubernetes Community Days London brings together hundreds of IT executives, cloud operators, and technology providers to discuss cloud computing and to learn about Kubernetes. The Kubernetes Community Day London is supported by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation and organized by supporting companies.

The conference will take place over 2 days in September of 2020, and will consist of a single talk track, and a workshop track. Talks are 25 minutes in length, including Q&A (which is completely optional), while workshops should be 2.5 hours long.

Talk sessions can include up to 2 speakers, and topics should be relevant to the current state of the Kubernetes and Cloud Native Ecosystem. Some topics that we would love to see:

- *Success and failure stories* - Experiences from the trenches are highly valuable to the community.
- *Technical deep-dives* - Share your expertise on technical topics.
- *Open Source project demonstrations* - Do you contribute to a project that fits into the kubernetes and cloud native evosystem? Why not talk about the what, why, and how!

**Please note:** Vendor-focused talks and sales pitches aren't likely to impress our program committee. We welcome submissions from vendors, however, please ensure your talk aligns with the community focus and is relevant to the cloud native open source ecosystem. Submissions from vendors that include end-user co-speakers will likely be shown more favourably.

## First time speaker?

Fear not! Local community driven conferences are a great place to get started as a technical speaker. We have a friendly and inclusive team of experienced speakers that would be more than happy to discuss talk ideas and assist with talk proposals. We strongly encourage you get in touch with us and to submit your talk ideas!

## What information should you include?

For us to effectively assess your submission we will be on the lookout for certain details within CfP submissions. Please endevour to address some or all of the following points:

- What benefit/value does your talk bring to the Kubernetes and/or Cloud Native Ecosystem?
- What do you hope the audience will learn from your talk?
- What makes you the best person to deliver this talk? If you have a unique experience we would love to hear it!
