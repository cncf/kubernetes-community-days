## Getting to Location

The only way to get to Bouvet Island is by boat. Bouvet Island is approximately 2,600 km (1,600 mi) south-southwest of the coast of South Africa. There is nothing even remotely usable as a harbor, although it is possible to anchor outside of it. If you are willing to put your life at risk, you might try using a light boat with outboard engine to enter.

There are no developed public-access airports or landing facilities.
