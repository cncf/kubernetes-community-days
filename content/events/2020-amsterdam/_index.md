Kubernetes Community Day comes back to Amsterdam after a great first edition and on the trail of [KubeCon EU Amsterdam](https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe-2020/). Check the [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQGLXxvf53b0fzCwFJSLRyn88bCoFNH2G) and the [photos](https://500px.com/cloudnativeams/galleries/kubernetes-community-day-amsterdam-2019) of last year, it was a lot of fun!

For 2020, we are going slightly bigger in attendance while mantaining the grassroot spirit and the community feeling that is our underlying theme; we selected a bigger, more spacious venue and we extended the program to 2 full days of technical talks, networking and bonding.

You will be able to buy a ticket for one or two days [here](hhttps://kubernetescommunitydays.org/) soon! You'll be able to buy a discounted early bird ticket before we announce the full lineup, then it's regular price (it's still quite cheap!).

We will soon announce our [speaker](speakers)'s lineup; the [call for papers](cfp) will also go live mid-February.
Our event would not be possible without support of our [sponsors](sponsor); prospective sponsors can review our [prospectus](prospectus) and get in touch with us via email. We're still finalizing our [program](program) but we're excited to have finalized a great [venue](venue). Please [contact](contact) the organizers with any questions.

Can't wait until September? We meet every month at our [Dutch Kubernetes Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Dutch-Kubernetes-Meetup/)! If you want to host, get in touch and if you want to give a talk, open a pull request to this [repository](https://github.com/cloudnative-amsterdam/meetups).

Kubernetes Community Day Amsterdam offers a [Diversity Scholarship](diversity-scholarship), apply by contacting us at [organizers-amsterdam@kubernetescommunitydays.org](mailto://organizers-amsterdam@kubernetescommunitydays.org).
