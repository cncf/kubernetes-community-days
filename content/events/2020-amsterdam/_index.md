**Kubernetes Community Day** comes back to Amsterdam! After a great first edition and on the trail of [KubeCon EU Amsterdam](https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe-2020/), the Dutch Cloud Native community is gathering at [Westergas](venue) in Amsterdam. Join us for a **two day technical conference** loaded with exciting talks and plenty of opportunity to exchange and network. 

Kubernetes Community Days Amsterdam is aimed at developers, operations people and all other IT professionals with an interest in cloud native technologies and are supported by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io). 

KCD Amsterdam is a community-organized and not for profit conference and would not be possible without **our partners**. Donâ€™t miss the opportunity to be part of and support this community conference. Find our [Partnership Proposal](sponsor) here.

For 2020, we are going slightly bigger in attendance while maintaining the grassroots spirit and the community feeling that is our underlying theme; we selected a bigger, more spacious [venue](venue) and we extended the program to **2 full days of technical talks**, networking and bonding.

**You will be able to buy a ticket for one or two days soon, with a discounted early bird ticket before we announce the full lineup, then it's regular price (it's still quite cheap!).** Keep an eye on our [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/cloudnativeams) and the official [Kubernetes Community Days](https://twitter.com/KubernetesDays)'.

We will soon announce our [speaker](speakers)'s lineup; the [call for papers](https://sessionize.com/kcdams2020) is open until 15th of May (we accept only talks in English). If you wonder how to submit a great talk, have a look at this [page](cfp).

Our event would not be possible without support of our [sponsors](sponsor); prospective sponsors can review our [prospectus](prospectus) and get in touch with us via email. We're still finalizing our [program](program) but we're excited to have finalized a great [venue](venue). Please [contact](contact) the organizers with any questions.

Can't wait until September? We meet every month at our [Dutch Kubernetes Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Dutch-Kubernetes-Meetup/)! If you want to host, get in touch and if you want to give a talk, open a pull request to this [repository](https://github.com/cloudnative-amsterdam/meetups).
