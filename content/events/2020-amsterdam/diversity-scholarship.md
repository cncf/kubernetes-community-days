# Diversity Scholarship Information

Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s diversity scholarship program provides support to those from traditionally underrepresented and/or marginalized groups in the technology and/or open source communities (including, but not limited to: persons identifying as LGBTQ, women, persons of color, and/or persons with disabilities) who may not otherwise have the opportunity to attend CNCF events for financial reasons.

A number of scholarships will be provided and recipients will receive up to $1500 to reimburse actual travel expenses. Please note that you will be responsible to arrange and reserve your hotel and flight directly. You will then be reimbursed up to the maximum stipend amount of $1,500 USD after the event. The stipend may only be used for the following: coach airfare, hotel/accommodations (up to four nights), and ground transportation (to and from the airport). Recipients will also receive complimentary conference registration and meals during the conference will be provided.

Scholarships are awarded based on a combination of need and impact. Selection will be made by an assembled group of reviewers who will assess each applicant’s request.  All application information will be kept confidential.
