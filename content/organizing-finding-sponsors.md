# Sponsorship
Role of sponsorship team/lead

* Identify likely sponsors
* Inquire whether those sponsors will contribute

Guidelines and rules

* Sponsorship do NOT automatically receive a speaker slots, we want to maintain a standard policy on the pricing inside a given event
* Sponsors will need to pay upfront to make the event work
* Sponsors cannot commercialize the event
* Sponsorship should cover 80-90% of total even budget
* Signing up sponsorships is a lot of work - two volunteers are better than one 
* Anchor sponsors will make it easy to get follow-on sponsors
* Sponsorship team works very closely with the finance team
* Be very clear in communicating with sponsors what they are getting and what the are NOT getting
* Sponsors do not get the attendess list. They may collect contact information at their booth.
* You can share demographics in aggregate to give sponsors a feel for what kind of crowd will attend.

Seeking out sponsorships

* Ideally one of the organizers will work for a sponsor
* Identify local companies that might want to sponsor
* Often CNCF members really like to sponsor community events (it builds their community cred)

Sponsor packages are decided upon by the local organizing team for a city. You can use the [examples](https://kubernetescommunitydays.org/organizing-cfp) in the template to help you make your decisions. Here are some typical offerings:

* Host (cost of venue): if a company sponsors the venue/food they will be acknowledged as a Host sponsor. Their logo will be directly visible on the main event page. They also have the opportunity to do a pre/post event meetup that will get promoted. And of course, they get the same benefits as Gold and Silver sponsors
* Gold (around 5000 Euro/USD): 6 included tickets + a ‘promo’ spot during talk intermissions + the ability to have a simple table/sponsor presence at the venue.
* Silver (around 3000 Euro/USD): 4 included tickets, sometimes half a table depending on the local event’s choices, sometimes just a single shared swag table.
* Bronze (around 1000 Euro/USD): 2 included tickets, sometimes can leave stickers/flyers/etc in public spaces
* Community Sponsor: get a logo on the site and acknowledgment on social media. Used for media outlets and other conferences that are interested in cross-promotion with you. Sometimes they’ll provide giveaways; usually, you will not ask them to provide cash.

Avoid the traditional high-priced model for sponsors. The more companies that sponsor, the better: it amplifies the ideas and shows that many companies subscribe to the Kubernetes Community Days idea.
