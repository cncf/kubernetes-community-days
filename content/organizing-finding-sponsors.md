# Sponsorship
Role of sponsorship team/lead

* Identify likely sponsors
* Inquire whether those sponsors will contribute

Guidelines and rules

* Sponsors do not automatically receive a speaker slot, we want to maintain a standard policy on the pricing inside a given event
* Sponsors will need to pay upfront to make the event work
* Sponsors cannot commercialize the event
* Sponsorship should cover 80-90% of total even budget
* Signing up sponsorships is a lot of work - two volunteers are better than one 
* Anchor sponsors will make it easy to get follow-on sponsors
* Sponsorship team works very closely with the finance team
* Be very clear in communicating with sponsors what they are getting and what the are NOT getting
* Sponsors do not get the attendees list. They may collect contact information at their booth.
* You can share demographics in aggregate to give sponsors a feel for what kind of crowd will attend.

Seeking out sponsorships

* Ideally one of the organizers will work for a sponsor
* Identify local companies that might want to sponsor
* Often CNCF members really like to sponsor community events (it builds their community cred)
post on Twitter and other social media
* Find local meetups/companies that can help you
* If you’re looking for a contact of a specific company that sponsored before,  contact the core organizers to see if they can help.
* Talk to the other organizers on Slack - many of them work at sponsors!
* Write a blog on the organizers' website to promote your event

Sponsor packages are decided upon by the local organizing team for a city. You can use the [examples](https://kubernetescommunitydays.org/organizing-cfp) in the template to help you make your decisions. Here are some typical offerings:

* Host (cost of venue): if a company sponsors the venue/food they will be acknowledged as a Host sponsor. Their logo will be directly visible on the main event page. They also have the opportunity to do a pre/post event meetup that will get promoted. And of course, they get the same benefits as Gold and Silver sponsors
* Gold (around 5000 Euro/USD): 6 included tickets + a ‘promo’ spot during talk intermissions + the ability to have a simple table/sponsor presence at the venue.
* Silver (around 3000 Euro/USD): 4 included tickets, sometimes half a table depending on the local event’s choices, sometimes just a single shared swag table.
* Bronze (around 1000 Euro/USD): 2 included tickets, sometimes can leave stickers/flyers/etc in public spaces
* Community Sponsor: get a logo on the site and acknowledgment on social media. Used for media outlets and other conferences that are interested in cross-promotion with you. Sometimes they’ll provide giveaways; usually, you will not ask them to provide cash.

Avoid the traditional high-priced model for sponsors. The more companies that sponsor, the better: it amplifies the ideas and shows that many companies subscribe to the Kubernetes Community Days idea.

* A lanyard sponsor
* An evening event sponsor
* A lunch or breaks sponsor

Sponsors will usually ask you the following; best to have this information ready.

* Projected number of attendees
* Industries/Companies represented (share only in aggregate)
* What they get with what level of sponsorship (refer them to your sponsor page)
* If they can buy a speaker spot (NO, but they can submit a talk, ignite or open space topic)
* If you provide a badge-scanning mechanism (no)
* If they will have electricity & network at the venue
* If they can get a monitor (let them bring their own or rent one themselves)
* Where to ship their stuff and pick it up (don’t take responsibility and let them handle that directly with venue)
* What size of table they have? Find out from the venue and say it has to fit behind the one table
* Where their table will be located (produce a map and let them choose in the order they signed up)

When the sponsor they need to supply:

* A .svg logo for the website
* URL to link it to
* Email address of a contact you can reach
* Twitter handle for you to thank (optionally)
* The invoice details (including VAT in Europe)

In return you’ll :

* Put the logo online
* Link it on the website
* Send the official invoice (as applicable)
* Once payment has been received, provide the registration discount code

On the registration page, have them select the special sponsor ticket with their discount. Many of the sponsor contacts may be traveling from event to event, you’ll have to follow up with them a bit so they sign up their crew in time for your badge printing. Make sure you make the invoices “due on receipt” or provide Paypal links so sponsors don’t wait months for them to pay you.
