**Kubernetes Community Days** are community-organized events that gather adopters and technologists from open source and cloud native communities to learn, collaborate, and network to further advancement in cloud native computing.

Backed by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io), which hosts Kubernetes, community-run events are meant to provide additional opportunities for speakers, practitioners, and end users to come together. Kubernetes Community Days will be run by local community members. Each event brings its own local flair, culture, diversity, and authenticity.

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation is here to support you as the organizer of your local Kubernetes Community Days event. The CNCF has defined specific event policies, guidelines, instructions, and some standards you will need to follow. We want it to serve as a useful tool of best practices to help you get started.

Kubernetes Community Days are non-commercial events and we expect them to run in accordance with the spirit of the community. This means making reasonable efforts to open the events to anyone in the community who wants to help organize, attend, or sponsor, regardless of affiliation. It also means avoiding sales pitches and focusing on educational and user-driven content.
