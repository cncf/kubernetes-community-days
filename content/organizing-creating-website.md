title: Creating a website for your event
---

Congratulations on preparing to host a Kubernetes Community Days in your city! This page will take you through the steps of setting up pages for your event on Kubernetes community days.org, which uses GitHub and Hugo to edit and publish your pages.

If you run into any issues when going through the process outlined in this document, please suggest changes or problems. This is a working document and will be updated as needed. 

# Create a GitHub Account
The first thing you need to do is create a GitHub account if you don't already have one. 

* Create your GitHub account here: https://github.com/ 
 * Enter your user name, email, password, and hit submit

 * You will receive an email to activate your account
 * Log in and get started!

# Interested in Organizing a Kubernetes Community Days?

* Go to https://github.com/cncf/kubernetes-community-days.
* If you are looking to find other organizers in your area, go to https://github.com/cncf/kubernetes-community-days/projects/2 and see if there are any events in your area.  If there is an event in progress or a past event, contact that events’ organizers to find out how you can get involved by adding a comment to their issue.

* If there are not any events in your area, open an issue:
  * Go to https://github.com/cncf/kubernetes-community-days/issues and click “New Issue”
/create issue.png

* In the “title” space enter “KCD <your city, your country>, Date (if you have one)”
* If you are just getting started fill in as much detail as possible about your event in the “write” space
  * Organizers information (name, company, title, email)
 * Target date (if you have one)
 * If you have any sponsors (name of company)
 * If you have any other organizers (name, company, title, email)
 * If you are looking for other organizers
 * Click “Submit new issue” when you are done
 
![Screenshot](/admin/img/howto/issue_filledout.png)

* Once your issues have been added to the project you can check its status here: https://github.com/cncf/kubernetes-community-days/projects/2 
* As you add organizers, update your issue
![Screenshot](/img/howto/updateissue.png)

When you have your 3 organizers and 2 sponsors and meet all the requirements of the “Getting Started Checklist” (https://kubernetescommunitydays.org/organizing/) fill out the lower part of the issue.
Update your issue:

* Check all the boxes, be sure to remove the space 
 * Enter all your organizers' information 
 * Enter who is CNCF representative
 * Enter who will manage the money
 * Identify Sponsors
 * Enter date, location, venue (if you have one selected)
 * When you have entered all your information “click submit new issue”

![Screenshot](/admin/img/howto/issuecomplete.png)

KCD organizers will then review your issue.

* Your issue will move to “Need organizers or sponsors” while be reviewed 
* Once approved to build your site. 

# Creating your Kubernetes Community Days Event Site
Once your issue is approved, you will receive your email alias and schedu account.
You will then create your website in the cncf/kubernetes-community-days/ repo. 
You will receive access to kcd-organizers slack channel.

If you are new to GitHub and Hugo, take a moment to review the GitHub glossary.

## Setting up your site. 
The first step is to create a fork. Creating a fork makes a copy of the site that you can edit. If you run into issues while editing you can always delete and start over. We also highly recommend creating branches off your fork, working off the branch, then merging the branch. Once your site is final, submit a pull request to have your fork reviewed and approved.

This document will walk you through all the steps to get your site live.

## What is a fork? 
A fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original. Forks remain attached to the original, allowing you to submit a pull request to the original's author to update with your changes. You can also keep your fork up to date by pulling in updates from the original.

Here is how to get started building your website. 
Go to https://github.com/cncf/kubernetes-community-days

* Creating a fork
 * Click on the “Fork” button in the upper left-hand side 

![Screenshot](/admin/img/howto/fork.png)

When your fork has been created you will see your name with the fork in the upper right-hand side

![Screenshot](/admin/img/howto/fork2.png)

## What is a branch? 
A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository but does not affect the primary or master branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the master branch to publish your changes. 

* Creating a branch
 * Be sure you are on your forked page, click fork in the upper right-hand corner

![Screenshot](/admin/img/howto/branch.png)

 * Check to make sure that you are in your forked reps (top arrow)
 * Name your branch (2nd arrow)
 * Click “blue” “create branch”(3rd arrow)
 
![Screenshot](/admin/img/howto/createfork.png)

 * Always check to be sure that you are in your Fork (1st arrow) and on your branch (2nd arrow) before you start editing.

## Pull request

Pull requests are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators. Like issues, pull requests each has its own discussion forum. For more information, see [About pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests).

## Merging a Branch - Creating a Pull Request
Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork) and applies them into another. This often happens as a pull request (which can be thought of as a request to merge), or via the command line. A merge can be done automatically via a pull request via the GitHub web interface if there are no conflicting changes, or can always be done via the command line. For more information, see [Merging a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/merging-a-pull-request).

Once you have made all your changes to branch you will want to merge it with your fork. You will need to create a Pull Request. Pull requests are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators. Like issues, pull requests each have their own discussion forum. For more information, see [About pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests).

# Synching Your Fork
When you create a fork of a repository (below are some instructions) you only have the versions of the files that are in the repository at that time. So if there are any changes in the original repository you may find that your version (your fork) is out of sync. Learn more about syncing your fork here. 

Syncing your fork to the original repository via the browser

* Open your fork of the repository.
* Click the compare button.

![Screenshot](/admin/img/howto/synchfork1.png)

This will open a page titled Comparing Changes and if you look carefully you'll have jumped to the upstream version of the repository. If you were to do a regular pull request then this makes sense as you'd be bringing your changes into the upstream version. But in this case, we want to flip the direction and pull changes from the original version to our fork.

* Change the base fork to your repository

![Screenshot](/admin/img/howto/synchfork2.png)

* You're now back to your fork but you've also asked to compare two identical repositories so GitHub thinks you care about branches, not forks.
* Click on compare across forks to get back your base fork option.

![Screenshot](/admin/img/howto/synchfork3.png)

* Change the head fork to the upstream (original) repository
![Screenshot](/admin/img/howto/synchfork4.png)

* You'll see one of two options:
  * "There isn’t anything to compare" This means you're up to date and you don't have to do anything. 
 * A list of commits. These are the changes that have happened in the repository since you forked your version. 
* Create a pull request

![Screenshot](/admin/img/howto/synchfork5.png)

Type in “LGTM”
Click “Create Pull Request”

![Screenshot](/admin/img/howto/synchfork6.png)

* Your Pull Request has been submitted for review 
* You can view what your site will look like by clicking on the link in the Netlify Section

![Screenshot](/admin/img/howto/synchfork7.png)

* Once your site is approved it will be live. 
* When you need to make changes, simply create a fork and a branch and start editing. 

# Tips for working on your page:
* Create a branch, mess around with it there
* Then open a PR
* Then merge it into master
* This squashes multiple changes into a single one, so we don't need to see your intermediate work
