# Proposed Kubernetes Community Days Review Process

Below is the process to get your event page set up once you have met the requirements to host your Kubernetes Community Days event.
* Create a Pull Request (PR) for your "Year-City" to request a website.
* CNCF will review the PR "New event for city x; closes #n" so that it closes the GitHub issue where the organizers came together.
* CNCF team will provide you with an email address and Sched account. The Sched account will be used to manage your program page.
* Organizers will confirm to CNCF team that email address works. 
* Your team will create your event pages using the Bouvet Island site as your template. 
 * If you are new to GitHub and Hugo you can follow these [step-by-step instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/114lN9Mi1_jbhudMk25NE7J_0wONRCx9jbJH9A-Af35s/edit?usp=sharing).
 * Be sure to create a fork, and used branches as you are editing your site.
* When you have completed your site CNCF will review the proposed events site in the staging server linked from the Pull Request to ensure: 
 * It has sufficient information to get started, including sponsor contact info
 * Is all of the metadata correct?
 * Have the organizer address of the form organizers-bouvet-island-2020@kubernetescommunitydays.org been created and did they verify that it works?
 * If there are any changes that need to be made CNCF team will update in the PR.
* Once this has been confirmed the CNCF team will merge your PR and your page will appear on [Kubernetes Community Days](https://kubernetescommunitydays.org/)
* Continue to update your site and submitting PR once your updates are complete. 
* CNCF team will review and merge content.
