title: Kubernetes Community Days Review Processe
---

Once you have met the hosting requirements for Kubernetes Community Days, next steps are:

* Create a new Issue titled with the "Year-City".
* CNCF will review the Issue "New event for city x; closes #n" so that it closes the GitHub issue #n where the organizers for the city came together.
* CNCF will provide you with an email address and Sched account. The Sched account will be used to manage your program page.
* Each organizer will respond to the initial contact from CNCF with Sched account information to verify that the email address works as expected. 
* Your team will create your event pages using the Bouvet Island site as your template. Follow the follow these [step-by-step instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/114lN9Mi1_jbhudMk25NE7J_0wONRCx9jbJH9A-Af35s/edit?usp=sharing) for the specific content areas that need to be updated.

  * Fork the kubernetes-community-days repository and make sure that your fork is up-to-date whenever you are making updates.
