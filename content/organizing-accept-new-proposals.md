# Proposed Kubernetes Community Days Review Process

Once you have met the hosting requirements for Kubernetes Community Days, next steps are:

* Create a Pull Request (PR) titled with the "Year-City".
* CNCF will review the PR "New event for city x; closes #n" so that it closes the GitHub issue #n where the organizers for the city came together.
* CNCF will provide you with an email address and Sched account. The Sched account will be used to manage your program page.
* You will verify that the email address works as expected. 
* Your team will create your event pages using the Bouvet Island site as your template. 
 * If you are new to GitHub and Hugo you can follow these [step-by-step instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/114lN9Mi1_jbhudMk25NE7J_0wONRCx9jbJH9A-Af35s/edit?usp=sharing).
 * Fork the kubernetes-community-days repository and make sure that your fork is up-to-date whenever you are making updates.
 * Create a new branch, and submit your PR from that branch rather than direct from the default branch.
* When your PR is ready, CNCF will review the proposed events site in the staging server linked from the Pull Request. The site must meet the following requirements: 
 * It has sufficient information to get started, including sponsor contact info
 * Is all of the metadata correct?
 * Have the organizer address of the form organizers-bouvet-island-2020@kubernetescommunitydays.org been created and did they verify that it works?
 * CNCF team will request any required changes in the PR.
* Once approved, CNCF team will merge your PR and your page will appear on [Kubernetes Community Days](https://kubernetescommunitydays.org/)
* Update your site by submitting new PRs. 
* CNCF team will review and merge content.
