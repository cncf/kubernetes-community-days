title: Kubernetes Community Days Review Processe
---

Once you have met the hosting requirements for Kubernetes Community Days, next steps are:

* Create a new Issue titled with the "Year-City".
* CNCF will review the Issue "New event for city x; closes #n" so that it closes the GitHub issue #n where the organizers for the city came together.
* CNCF will provide you with an email address and Sched account. The Sched account will be used to manage your program page.
* Each organizer will respond to the initial contact from CNCF with Sched account information to verify that the email address works as expected. 
* Your team will create your event pages using the Bouvet Island site as your template. Follow the follow these [step-by-step instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/114lN9Mi1_jbhudMk25NE7J_0wONRCx9jbJH9A-Af35s/edit?usp=sharing) for the specific content areas that need to be updated.
  * If you are new to GitHub and Hugo the [step-by-step instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/114lN9Mi1_jbhudMk25NE7J_0wONRCx9jbJH9A-Af35s/edit?usp=sharing) also include information to handle these tools.
  * Fork the kubernetes-community-days repository and make sure that your fork is up-to-date whenever you are making updates.
  * Create a new branch, and submit your PR from that branch rather than direct from the default branch.
  * Update the site with your new content.
* When your PR is ready, CNCF will review the proposed events site in the staging server linked from the Pull Request. The site must include the following minimum requirements: 
  * Event date, 
  * Venue, 
  * CFP dates, 
  * At least 3 sponsors listed, 
  * Sponsorship prospectus, 
  * Contact information for the organizers, and 
  * the code of conduct. 
* CNCF team will request any required changes in the PR.
* Once approved, CNCF team will merge your PR and your page will appear on [Kubernetes Community Days](https://kubernetescommunitydays.org/)
* Update your site by submitting new PRs. 
* CNCF team will review and merge content.
