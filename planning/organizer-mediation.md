Kubernetes Community Days are community organized and run, but they reflect back upon both Kubernetes, CNCF, and the wider cloud native community. It is in the best interest of everyone involved that the events run smoothly and the community has a great experience. Organizing events can also be challenging, and organizers may not agree at every step of the process. In order to run the events as smoothly as possible, it is important that compromises can be reached and differences overcome. CNCF is available to help mediate discussions between organizers to make your event and the KCD program as a whole successful.

**How to get help**
It is always better to ask for help earlier rather than once the issues have begun to grow. CNCF is available to help at every step of the process and we want your event to be successful. In order to help us help you, we should be looped in as early as possible to any problems. 

1. You can reach out to the core organizers at any time at kcd@cncf.io. Describe the situation as fully and completely as you can.
2. CNCF staff will review the case and determine next steps. This may include, but is not limited to replying to all parties by email, setting up and mediating a meeting between all interested parties, or making modifications to how the event is organized or run.
3. If a compromise that all parties can agree upon cannot be reached, CNCF reserves the right to remove the KCD from the program.

CNCF wants your event to be a success and we are here to help your team overcome any challenges in the planning and execution of your KCD.
