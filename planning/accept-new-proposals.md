Once you have met the hosting requirements for Kubernetes Community Days, the next steps are:

## Forming and finding your team
To start a KCD or find/join one in your area, [check the issue board](https://github.com/cncf/kubernetes-community-days/projects/2) to see if there is already one in your region. If there is one, join the conversation. If not, please start a new discussion on Github with the format Year - Location. Once you have a core group formed proceed with the steps below.

## Getting your event accepted
* Create a new Issue titled "Year-City".
* CNCF will provide you with an email address and access to set up your [CNCG event](https://community.cncf.io/).
* Each organizer will respond to the initial contact from CNCF to verify that the email address works as expected.
* Your team will create your event pages using the Bouvet Island site as your template. Follow the follow these [step-by-step instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/114lN9Mi1_jbhudMk25NE7J_0wONRCx9jbJH9A-Af35s/edit?usp=sharing) for the specific content areas that need to be updated.

  * Fork the kubernetes-community-days repository and make sure that your fork is up-to-date whenever you are making updates.
  * Create a new branch, and submit your PR from that branch rather than direct from the default branch.
