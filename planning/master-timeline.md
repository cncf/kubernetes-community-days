## Hosting a Kubernetes Community Days Event
This is a suggested planning timeline for running a successful event. Use the Kubernetes Community Days Conference Action Items and Assignments to assign tasks and deadlines to team members.  

### 8-9 MONTHS IN ADVANCE          
Begin to Plan for the event:

* Start a discussion on Github to see if anyone else in your area is interested in organizing an event.
* Make a pull request on GitHub to notify the Cloud Native Computing Foundation you intend to host a Kubernetes Community Day. 
* List out the the goals and objectives for the event (include # of attendees, # of sponsors, # of speaking sessions, etc.)
* Name your event: Kubernetes Community Days + Location (e.g. Kubernetes Community Days Sydney or Kubernetes Community Days Australia).
 * This name will be used on the website and all outbound communications.
* Select a date or dates for the event.
 * The event can be one-day or two-days.
 * It can include various tracks, upstream training, sponsor exhibit area, VIP event, happy hour, etc.
 * If this is the first event, we recommend you start with a one-day event.
 * Make sure there are no other Kubernetes events, related conferences or holidays scheduled at the same time

Recruit an event team and sponsors:

* Begin to recruit members for your Kubernetes Community Days Advisory Board Steering Committee.
 * This team should be at least 4 individuals from 4 different companies
* Look for co-organizers with event expertise to help organize (Some organizers have decided to hire an event coordinator for this purpose
* Recruit the three required sponsoring companies (usually they are where co-organizers work)

Guidelines, Toolkit, and support:

* Once your event is approved, CNCF will do the following:
 * Give you a Hugo Template to build out the site.
 * Add you to the Kubernetes Community Days Organizers Slack Channel (so you can ask questions and best practices from other KCD organizers)
 * Use the tools at the bottom of the [organizing page](/planning/)

Select and reserve a venue (for in person):

* Choose a venue with a reception area for registrations, a room dedicated for keynote presentations, and at least one break out room.
 * This allows you to run 2 event tracks
 * You can use the break out room for demonstrations, trainings, or workshops.
* Consider hosting the Kubernetes Community Days event at one of the organizing company’s offices
* For first time events, consider starting with a maximum of 200 attendees

Communications:

* Create a private slack channel for the group.
* Join the Kubernetes Community Days Public Slack channel
* Get an event Twitter handle and announce the event there as a placeholderPublish the event on the Kubernetes Days schedule page
* Create a placeholder Webpage for the event announcing date(s) with an email contact address
* Get email address from CNCF for your organizers 

### 6-7 MONTHS IN ADVANCE:

Budget and finance:

* Prepare a preliminary budget including:
* Total event costs (Venue costs, hotel room blocks, catering, signage, graphics, promotion, A/V, travel for speakers, etc.).
* Required sponsorship money
* Expected attendee fees
* 10% extra for incidentals/unforeseen items

Team roles and responsibilities:

* Create an advisory team to help organize the event and define roles and responsibilities

Keynote Speakers:

* Identify from potential keynote speakers to attract both attendees and sponsors.
* See if anyone in the Kubernetes Speakers Bureau would be a good keynote and check availability.
* Focus on pulling diverse keynoters as much as possible.
* Assign outreach to potential speakers and get confirmations ASAP (note: be cognizant that if you ask multiple speakers simultaneously and they all accept, you may have to cancel which is not great. Far better is to request a quick response and ask one at a time until the slate is full)

Identify possible sponsors:

* Create a target list of possible sponsors to contact 
* Look at employers of [CNCF Speakers Bureau](https://www.cncf.io/speakers/) members and CNCF Ambassadors or potential sponsorship
* Identify companies that have sponsored or are sponsoring related events
* Build an outreach plan and assign contacts
