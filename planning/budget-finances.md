# Budget and Finances


### Basic guidelines

* Add up the budgets (venue, food, parties space, schwag, scholarships) to generate a total event budget to determine the amount of money needed to cover costs
* Plan on covering most of the expenses through sponsorships to keep ticket prices low
* Ticket prices should generally be somewhere between $30 and $100, depending on location, event costs, and event format
* Tickets for virtual events should be free or extremely low cost ($5-10)
* Allocate budget for scholarships/discounts for students and underrepresented groups
* You can also use fund to expand the cloud native community like 
  * Sponsoring people to go to KubeCon
  * Paying for training and certification
  * Providing access to the event (travel & data costs, ect)
* Allow 10% overage as there are often unexpected costs

### Role of finance team/lead

* Invoicing sponsors and accepting their payments
* Accepting money from and (as needed) sending official invoices to people that register
* Paying suppliers like the venue, catering, T-shirts, etc

### Finance sponsor/management options
The way many  organizers have handled money management is to find a local company that is willing to handle the logistics. In some countries, a local company is the only way to handle the taxes.

Option 1: One of the organizer's companies serve as the financial sponsor. They will need to be able to do the following:

* Have a way to collect all the money from sponsors and registration
* Invoice sponsors 
* Pay suppliers like the venue, catering, T-shirts, etc.

Option 2: If a local company is not an option, we recommend several companies that are willing to help you for a fee, generally 10%.
