# Choosing your KCD event date
When considering event dates for your KCD, there are many facotrs.

### Venue Availability
Dependent on the country, some venues can easily book out 2 years in advance. Reminder: You may not announce your KCD until your contract with a venue is signed.

### Other KCDs in Your Region
Plase make a note of the following:
* If you are in a large country, we now require that each KCD within the same country should occur no closer than 2 months apart.
* If you are in Europe, it is easy to travel to another KCD by train. Similarly, in the Asia Pacific region, a 3-hour flight also meets the same standard

### Competitive Events
Please utilize your organizer networks to explore surrounding events that may be happening at the same time, or within two-month's time. CNCF is only responsible for guiding you around other KCDs and CNCF & Linux Foundation-hosted events.

### Holidays
Always consider not only your current country's holidays, but regional holidays that might affect speakers traveling to your KCD event.

### The Work Week
This is based on your culture and typical attendance:
* Is it typical of your culture to work lightly on Fridays?
* Is it typically of your culture to only be able to attend events on weekends?
* Is it acceptable for your culture to attend events during the week if it will help their current job? If so, consider a day where it might be a standard to not have meetings.
For example, some companies in the US have a "White Space Wednesday", meaning you can see the white space on your calendar because there are no meetings that day.
* Also, what is traditionally acceptable in terms of number of days during a week an employee can attend an event?
